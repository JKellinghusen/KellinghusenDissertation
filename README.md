The Data Processor (R Data Processor.r) and App Builder (app.R) are located in the R Data Analysis folder. 
Only the App Builder needs to be run to load the Dashboard.
The run_app.R file runs the dashboard continuously in a browser and reflects changes made in app.r, facilitating live editing and refinement.
